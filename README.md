# Model Samples and Bitwig

A how-to for gear I don't really understand yet..

## Preface

This tutorial is setup to have the Model:Samples control Bitwig Start/Stop as well as send basic MIDI notes to it. You can of course have Bitwig talk to the M:S instead but this tutorial is just for getting started and learning something new :smile:

The Project on the M:S will not focus on any on board samples for this tutorial. It will be used purely as a MIDI controller.

The idea of this tutorial is to make fun sounds using Bitwig so that you can then import the saved files into your M:S later and use the live performance knobs to tweak and have fun.

**Make sure these next steps are taken care of before we begin!**

1. Up to date firmware on the Model:Samples
1. Connect Model:Samples to your computer via USB

_Now we begin!_

### On the Model:Samples

#### Start a New Project

Then on Track 1 turn down the volume of the sample to 0 if you are monitoring your M:S in another program (Audacity/whatever else)
